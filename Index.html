<p id="description">
	From November 1975 to September 1976, artist Roy Colmer 
	photographed every door he passed while walking the streets of New York. He then 
	organized them sequentially, grouped them by location. From 2022 to 2024, I collected
	audio clips of conversations with current residents, business owners, and visitors 
	passing in and out of these doors. I did so with the intention of answering these 
	questions: What was behind these doors? What <i>is</i> behind these doors? I've compiled 
	some of Colmer's doors into this new archive where you can group and search for them,
	not by street, block, and building number, but by key words that describe the stories 
	and memories related to them. The website is relatively small and the search function 
	isn't perfect yet (for example, you cannot search for synonyms or near-matches) but I hope 
	that it nevertheless reveals the potential to expand, reorganize, and reimagine the 
	archive.</p>
